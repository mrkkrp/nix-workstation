# NixOS instructions

**WIP, don't waste your time here.**

This document describes how to install [NixOS](https://nixos.org) and
configure it how I like it.

TODO Copy from the official instructions but adjust for Wi-Fi stuff and UEFI

## Mics setup for normal user

This is done by running several bash scripts.

```
$ ./git.sh
$ ./projects.sh
```
